Votebot (version 0.9.4) by Adam Cz.

A small proof-of-concept bot to show an automation process of voting
on a radio page with usage of threading and TOR processes. It was written
as fast as possible, so it can still contain a lot of minor bugs.

Remember to edit TOR_PATH global at the beginning, depending on which OS
you are using! You can download TOR client from https://www.torproject.org/

To run the bot you need to have a list of necessary packages installed. 
You can to that by using PIP:
pip install pyqt5 stem requests[socks] beautifulsoup4 psutil
